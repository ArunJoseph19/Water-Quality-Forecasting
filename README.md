# Water Quality Forecasting Kaveri River

Water quality is a global problem which affects human beings' lives fundamentally. 
In the present study using time series modelling, the quality of the river water is studied. Using 
historical data collected from the pollution control board 8 parameters of water quality are studied, 
such as Dissolved Oxygen, Temperature, PH, Conductivity, Biological Oxygen Demand, Nitrate, 
Nitrite, Faecal Coliform, and Total Coliform. <br><br>
We also developed an Internet-of-things device that 
measures 4 parameters i.e. Temperature, PH, Total dissolved salts, and Turbidity. in real time and 
uploads the data to the cloud. We developed a dashboard that provides investigation on the 
observed time series and shows different trends for all parameters. <br><br>
In this study we compare the ARIMA (autoregressive, integrated, moving average) model and Recurrent Neural Network to 
generate and forecast the quality of river water. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) criteria shall 
be used for evaluating the generation and forecasting results.
